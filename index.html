        <h1>Conquer the Suffering: A Mixed-Reality Himalayan Soundscape</h1>
        <p>
            We are pleased to present <i>Conquer the Suffering</i>, a collaboration
            between Dr. Cecilia Wu and Daniel Schreck, for consideration
            under the <i>Rubin x Art Projects</i> Grant Program. This project aligns with the Rubin Museum’s vision of expanding into digital spaces, creating a "museum without walls" where Himalayan art and wisdom can reach audiences beyond physical boundaries. By merging traditional Buddhist ritual sounds with modern technology, Conquer the Suffering offers an immersive experience that preserves and reinterprets ancient traditions for contemporary engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dr. Wu’s expertise in music production, spatial audio, and sound design brings together Nepalese, Bhutanese, and Tibetan Buddhist ritual instruments, spiritual chants, and electronic composition to create deeply resonant surround sound environments. These Himalayan immersive soundscapes interact with Daniel Schreck’s virtual reality landscapes in real-time, designed to transmit Tibetan Buddhist wisdom through cross-platform spatial computing systems such as Unity, OpenXR, and RealityKit. Using real-time Ambisonics surround sound technology, the evolving soundscapes and visuals work together to create an engaging dynamic environment—whether unfolding as mandala-like fractal art structures, shifting gradients of light, or tranquil mountain vistas—all reinforcing themes of resilience, introspection, and transformation.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the Rubin Museum expands its digital presence, this project offers a powerful and innovative way to engage global audiences in Himalayan contemplative practices through modern technology. By leveraging VR, Conquer the Suffering extends beyond traditional museum experiences, making these teachings more accessible, engaging, and interactive. This fusion of ancient wisdom and contemporary innovation supports the museum’s mission to preserve and share Himalayan culture in ways that resonate with today’s audiences. We believe this collaboration is not only well-aligned with the Rubin Museum’s evolving direction but also a valuable contribution to its future initiatives.

              <b>Sound of Nangqên</b> is an electroacoustic audiovisual composition that explores the interplay between sound,
              space, and culture, inspired by Tibet’s "Highland of Zen" in Nangqên County, Qinghai Province, China.
              Fully permitted, supported, and funded by the Nangqên County, the local monasteries, and the Tibetan
              people, this work immerses listeners in the region’s rich spiritual and cultural soundscape, integrating 20
              gigabytes of field recordings—encompassing natural environments, local voices, folk songs, daily life,
              and traditional Tibetan instruments—with analog and digital electronic
              processing. We envision <b>Sound of Nangqên</b> as an
              audiovisual inspiration for the immersive environments that we
              will develop to accompany <b>Conquer the Suffering</b>.
              A potential avenue for artistic development is virtual environments for <i>Sound of Nangqen</i> itself, offering
              users the experience of spatial surround audio together with
              immersive Himalayan-inspired visuals.

              <b>Conquer the Suffering</b> is a musical exploration that draws
              inspiration from Nepali diverse musical traditions, capturing its
              spiritual soundscapes, cultural nuances, and the people's resilience.
              This composition is constructed from the sounds of traditional Nepali
              and Tibetan Buddhist ritual instruments, soulful vocals, and nuanced
              electronic elements. The visual component of <b>Conquer the
                  Suffering</b> will be the central focus of artistic development for
              the present project.

              Daniel Schreck (<a href="assets/dschreck_resume2025.pdf"
                  target="_blank">Resume</a>) is a graduate student in the Computer
              Science department at Stanford University, exploring the intersection of
              AI, virtual reality, and contemplative practices. A M.S. candidate in
              the artificial intelligence track, he specializes in system design and
              HCI inspired by modern cognitive science. Originally from New York City,
              he earned his Sc.B. in
              <a href="https://carney.brown.edu/">Neuroscience from Brown
                  University</a>, where he conducted <a

                  in retinal neurobiology</a> at the Berson Lab and
              the cognitive impacts of meditation in the <a
              href="https://sites.brown.edu/britton/">CLAN-Lab</a>, investigating the neural correlates of meditative states.
            Daniel's work spans machine learning, computer vision, and human-computer interaction,
            with a present focus on building immersive VR environments for meditation. 
            His current
            projects include <a href="https://silofocus.app">Silo</a>, a neuroscience-driven application for reducing
            screen-time addiction, and <a href="https://yourdb.app">YourDB</a>, a cloud-based database infrastructure startup.
        </p>
         <p>
             Passionate about education and mentorship, Daniel has served as a teaching assistant
             for <a href="https://cs107.stanford.edu">CS107 (Computer Systems)</a>, guiding
             students through systems programming, memory management, and software engineering
             principles, and <a href="https://cs193p.stanford.edu">CS193p (iOS Development
                 with SwiftUI)</a>, preparing the
             course for free access to the public. Today, he's inspired by findings on gamma-wave
             oscillation patterns in meditators within Tibetan traditions (e.g. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC526201/">Davidson et al.</a>), and he is interested in
             developing VR technologies that help meditators access a variety of contemplative
             states and practices.
